# Variables and datatypes in java

- Variable in java is data container that stores the data values during java program execution. 

- Every variable is assigned a data types meaning the type and quantity of value it can hold.

__Real life example__:

- We all know about medical/pharmacy units. Here the tablets/tonics are stored in boxes in alphabetical order.
- The box/container with alphabets are nothing but data types, the tablets boxes or tonic bottles are the variable names, the core liquid in bottle or tab inside the tablet sheet is the value stored in variable

- For example: Box alphabet: P( data type)
               This contains Parcetmol tablet sheet( variable name)
               parcetmol tablet(value inside the sheet)


## Variable declaration & initialization:

- int number -->Varibale declaration --> int is a datatype and number is variable name

- number = 10 --> variable initialization, number is a container which is holding a value of 10.

- int number = 10 -> this is combination of declaration and initialization

## Types of variables:

In java there are three types of variables. Local variables, Instance varibales, Static variables.

- __Local Variables__: variables declared inside the body of a method

- __Instance variables__: variables are defined without static keyword. these are defined outside method declaration. Object specific and known as instance variables.

- __Static variables__: initiated only once, at the start of the program execution. These variables should be initialized first, before the initialization of any instance variables.


## Data Types:

- DataTypes are specifiers that allocate different sizes and types of values that can be stored in variable or an identifier.

- Data types in java are divided into two parts. 1) Primitive datatypes: int,char,boolean, float.
2) Non-primitive datatypes: classes, arrays and interfaces

 __Primitive Data types__:

- Primitive datatypes are predefined and available within java language. Primitives values do not state with other primitive values.

- __Integer datatypes__:
  byte -> 1byte
  short -> 2 bytes
  int  -> 4 bytes
  long -> 8 bytes

- __Floating Datatypes__:
 float -> 4 bytes
 double -> 8 bytes

- Textual datatype: char-> 2 bytes

- logical : boolean -> 1 byte
